rom the creation of the calendar that the Gregorian calendar was (indirectly) based off of over a thousand years ago the days per month were inconsistent.
It went beck and forth between 29 and 30 and as changes to the design were made days were shifted more, and we eventually got to the mess that we now call a calendar.
Like who thought that was a good idea??
The Gregorian calendar was also designed with the idea of christen holidays in mind.
It’s kinda odd how so many time related systems are christen influenced.
Like the calender system that we still use and the year numbering itself.
I mean not that many but two is still a lot, anyway.

This modification would make date keeping so much more consistent, systems like this existed in many ancient cultures and they had spectacular results.
I think that removing the religious aspect from the systems we all use is something we should work for.
There are lots of different religions people have as well as people who don’t have any, and I think that it’s really fair for one group’s religions beliefs to be forced on everyone.
Sadly I don’t think It will catch on any time soon, but that’s not going to stop me!
