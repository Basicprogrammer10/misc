# tgm_metadetector

Uses multiple 'AI text detectors' and returns how likely each one thinks is to be generated with a LLM.

You probally think this was made to aid with bypassing these checkers.
But because I am a normal human, I made this to try to see if I can consistently pretend to write like the LLMs and fool the detectors.
